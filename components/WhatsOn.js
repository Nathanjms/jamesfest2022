        Firstly, the venue. We know you&apos;ll love its beautiful trees,
        natural grounds and wonderful countryside views. Back in the 1930&apos;s
        it was a horticultural college which explains why so many lovely and
        unusual trees can be found there. We have chosen a &quot;special&quot;
        tree, around which we intend to hold our wedding ceremonyâ€¦

        After the ceremony, you can enjoy a reception drink while taking in the
        breath-taking scenery or maybe take a leisurely wander around the
        grounds. After some photographs, we&apos;ll all be served an afternoon
        tea in our magical tipi.

        We have a great afternoon planned for you; a series of musical acts
        throughout the day, with some lively communal games to keep us on our
        toes. Let&apos;s try to break the record for the most people playing in
        a rounder&apos;s game!!

        We&apos;ll have an antique ice cream cart on duty throughout the
        afternoon and of course an outdoor bar. In the early evening we will be
        serving street food outside the tipi.

        As the sun starts to set we plan to stage a communal sing-along around
        the fire-pits, before returning to the tipi for an all-night dance off
        with the fabulous Ellie Jones and the Giants.
